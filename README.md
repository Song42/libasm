# libasm

### library assembly
Basic project about undertanding low-level programming by implementing standard C library functions in x86_64 assembly using Intel syntax and NASM assembler.
This project requires writing a static library libasm.a which contains the following functions:
- read
- write
- strlen
- strcmp
- strcpy
- strdup

NOTE: all system calls must have error handlling and proper errno setting, also no inline assembly was used.
